<h2>What's special about Kyoto food?</h2>

<p> 
Kyoto cuisine uses plenty of old Japanese ingredients, such as tofu, matcha, bracken starch, and kudzu. It also has plenty of preserved fish, such as dried herrings and salt-pickled mackerel, a fitting trait for a land-locked city.

As for sushi, there are mackerel and pickled sushi, enjoyable for their unusual appearances. Another classic dish is kaiseki, a variety of foods that changes with the season and truly has an air of Japanese tradition. The cuisine also makes use of kombu and dashi.

Though it costs more and takes longer than other foods, Kyoto cuisine is definitely worth experiencing. There are also tasty Japanese desserts out there, such as bracken starch mochi, kudzu noodles, and matcha parfaits.
